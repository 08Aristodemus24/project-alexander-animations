# A repository that will store all the animations I will test and use in my portfolio website `project-alexander`

1. `manim -pql <scenes.py> <class name>` will create the animation given a "template" defined as our class
2. `manim -pqh <scenes.py> <class name>` will create the animation in high quality given the `qh` part in the -pqh flag which means quality will be high of the outputted video
